# The Bad Ragas Bio (Reference)

The Bad Ragas began in Zurich's rock scene, where their energetic live shows carried them to the Swiss finals of the Emergenza competition.

Now based in the UK, they've evolved into a stripped-back but dynamic trio. Andy (vocals, guitar), Sarah (vocals, baritone ukulele), and Ray (violin) craft a sound that's soulful, gritty, and full of surprise, weaving originals like "Reload" with inventive covers that reshape familiar songs in unexpected ways.
